# Crypto_Currency_Market_Financial_Risk_Management
## Overview
This project explores financial risk management in the cryptocurrency market using **machine learning techniques**, specifically **Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. The study aims to improve risk assessment and portfolio management by leveraging AI-driven strategies.

## Features
- **Risk Evaluation:** Identification and assessment of **inherent risks** in cryptocurrency investments.
- **Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP):** Portfolio optimization using hierarchical clustering techniques.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Adaptive risk management for digital assets.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluation against traditional risk-based portfolio strategies.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Analyzes historical cryptocurrency price trends from **2017 to 2020**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)**
- **Data Processing (Pandas, NumPy)**
- **Financial Modeling & Analysis**
